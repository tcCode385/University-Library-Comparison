### Tableau presentation comparing two unversity libraries

This repository containes a Tableau presentation I prepared which compares UNCW's Randall Library services to Binghamton's Library services.

This was my first time working with Tableau and I created this presentation in a week.  
I chose to use Tableau's color blindness color palette since I was presenting to a group of about thirty people.
